            "Docid 1297: pros - nice headphones with superb bass cons - the headphones are a bit tight fit and wireless range is just about 5 meters & get disconnected automatically if we go a bit distance more but also get connected automatically if back in range☺\n",
            "Docid 1298: this is my first boat...  i already own 6 headphones senieser, sony, philips, skullcandy ,inear sony, jbl etc.  after experiencing all this well-known brands...  i never expected this amazing output from boat, at this price  point.. it's different to hear all my favorite tracks again in this piece and.... enjoying.. a small tip- laptop or mobile,dont go for the equalizer or bass boosted..  just play it flat.. and quality tracks 320kbps or higher flac's.. the results will blow your mind\n",

            "Docid 1971: go for it blindly. the sound quality will mesmerize you. dont go by the naysayers. those complaining about the tightness have probably never used a headphone before. it is bound to be a little tight else it will fall off your head. regarding the sound clarity it is clear and crisp. the bass is thumpingly good. what else do you expect in 999?\n",

            "Docid 2022: the only factor where these headphones lose out is comfort. they tend to hurt after long use. other than that these are worth every penny you pay. sound quality is excellent, bass is excellent. but the inbuilt mic is not good. and also the bluetooth connectivity while walking tends to break. if you are planning to buy headphones for music, definitely go for them.\n",

            "Docid 699: headphones are of great quality build wise and if one needs to hit nirvana while traveling. somehow the option of using the headphones with wire is not as pleasant of a listening experience as it is with the bt. when used with bt for making calls people often complained about them not being able to listen to what i was saying. the microphone isn't good enough.\n",

            "Docid 709: as compare to other brands on this price range it's superb. great sound with deep bass but not a smooth sound, all music sounds are feels like the same bass, disappointing in great music quality, only bass is good, build quality is avarage\n",
            "Docid 722: i got this rockerz today. i listened it for 3-4 hours, the sound was smooth, the lows the mids and the highs are balanced. the design is cool and light weight. it has a good battery backup and bluetooth connection is good as well. and the best thing about this headphone is, it has an aux cable if your battery drains out, it can be used as a wired headset as well. it is little tight on ears, but this is manageable. thank u flipkart for a quick delivery. it's a great deal in this price range, w...\n",

            "Docid 737: it has everything that you search in a good headphone. sound is really good and melodious. bass is good and so does the fitting. it hurts for a while in the start but after a few days, it adjusts automatically. i don't know if it worths the money or not but i do believe so. it charges fast and runs for long, also provides great comfort.\n",
            "Docid 745: overall a good product with great sound.the only thing i found as an improvement is it should not fit too tight on the head and over the ears.when i use this, my ears can feel the pressure right from the moment i start using them. so this needs to be improved.\n",

            "Docid 832: awesome product. i'm a guy who spends so many hours trying to find the best product, and i ended up on this, so according to me this is the best. also, being wireless is a great advantage, i realized this after i used it. it's a great convenience. plus, the range is quite good so i can keep my phone in a corner of my house and can move around the house, it begins to crackle a bit at around 5 metres. plus, apart from being wireless, we can also use it with an aux cable(included in the box)...\n",

            "Docid 1045: for this price range it's a nice product. but it has some con's like, when the headset is in bluetooth mode it's mic doesn't work properly but speaker was good.when using aux cable both speaker and mic are working good.for pubg game it's nice only when using aux cable, while in bluetooth mode again there is a problem with the mic. so if u need to play pubg in bluetooth mode,it's not suitable for you. but if you use this only for hearing songs means you should go for it. overall the sound ...\n",
